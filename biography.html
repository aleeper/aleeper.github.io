<h1>Adam E. Leeper - Biography</h1>
</div>
<p>Adam enjoys solving problems, and teaching others about solving problems.
His technical interests span software and electro-mechanical systems: software
architecture, API design, dynamic simulation, sensors, and control, especially
in the context of robotics and user-interactive applications.</p>
<p>Adam has been at Google since 2014 working on ARCore, Google's platform for
augmented reality on smartphones, and currently leads the ARCore API team as an
engineering manager. Before Google, he authored a number of open-source
software packages for robot teleoperation at Willow Garage, and worked on
algorithms for visual-inertial SLAM at hiDOF. </p>
<p>Adam received his Ph.D. (2013) and M.S. (2009) in Mechanical Engineering from
Stanford University, where he was a member of the Salisbury BioRobotics
Laboratory. His dissertation research included topics in teleoperation, 3D
perception, haptic rendering, and robot control. Adam received his B.S. in
Engineering Physics from The University of Tulsa in 2007.</p>
<p>Adam is passionate about teaching, and enjoys developing interactive in-class
and online elements to enrich student learning. From 2011-2016 he taught
classes in engineering mechanics (statics, dynamics, and control) at Stanford
University and San Jose State University. Previously, he was an instructor at
Stanford's EPGY Summer Institutes, and he was a course assistant for courses in
dynamics, robotics, and haptics.</p>
<p>Adam is a native of Colorado Springs, CO, but has embraced the similarly
idyllic setting in the San Francisco Bay Area. He loves mountains, airplanes,
volleyball, and music production.</p>
